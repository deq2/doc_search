## Instructions to Run

Requires docker-compose

To run with docker:
docker-compose up --build


To run locally from the command line (requires flask and Python 3):
export FLASK_APP=app
cd app
python app.py

In both cases, the app should run on localhost:5000. On the first page, enter the root directory for the app.
From there you should be redirected to a page where you can enter directories such as "/",
"/test", "/test/foo", etc.

To run the tests:
pip install pytest
cd app
python app.test.py.
